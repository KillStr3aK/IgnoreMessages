# IgnoreMessages

This plugin can remove the messages from the chat. You can specify the message keys that should be ignored.

By default I've supplied the configuration with random keys but mostly related to cash messages and it has the `PrintKeyNames` disabled.

> [!NOTE]  
> Required CSSharp version: **315**

# Configuration

Message keys are found in: `../game/csgo/resource/csgo_english.txt`

> [!WARNING]  
> When adding new message keys to the configuration dont forget the `#` in the beginning.
